#Introduction

Tools to generate charts, graphs, plots are quite popular these days, and for good reason. They can help turn millions of numbers into something tangible and understandable. [Knowledgent](http://knowledgent.com/infographics/data-viz-101/) says the following about data visualization:

```
A well-crafted data visualization helps uncover trends,
realize insights, explore sources, and tell stories.
```

Let's look at an example here. Of the two following images, which one can you quickly come to a conclusion with?:

(1)
```
preferences =
{"beer1"=>[24, 25],
 "beer2"=>[57, 59],
 "beer3"=>[41, 38],
 "beer4"=>[46, 48],
 "beer5"=>[77, 80],
 "beer6"=>[72, 67],
 "beer7"=>[14, 11],
 "beer8"=>[84, 79],
 "beer9"=>[34, 39],
 "beer10"=>[20, 19],
 "beer11"=>[21, 16],
 "beer12"=>[73, 69],
 "beer13"=>[35, 40],
 "beer14"=>[83, 85],
 "beer15"=>[40, 45],
 "beer16"=>[10, 11],
 "beer17"=>[71, 68],
 "beer18"=>[45, 50],
 "beer19"=>[56, 54],
 "beer20"=>[20, 23]}
```

Each point in the scatter plot is a comparison of two user's beer ratings of a particular beer. Looks like we both like `beer8` (which is probably some really hoppy IPA if you're like me) a lot. Unless you can do some impressive math and calculations by just looking at data, (2) provides some meaningful analysis quickly. Without (2), we would be harder pressed to glean something important from (1). Imagine if we had 1,000 beers to compare between us, or we had a database of 1,000,000 users! Which approach would could help us say something meaningful? Let's figure out how we can take advantage of the data visualization tools out there.

This tutorial will cover the following

* What tools can I use to visualize data with html?
* How do I make a Rails API to deliver data I care about?
* How do I visualize the data from my Rails API?

##Part 1 - Scalable Vector Graphics
This section covers SVG, or *scalable vector graphics*, as an introduction to graphing data with html.

##Part 2 - The Highcharts Javascript Charting Library
This section is an introduction to the [Highcharts](http://www.highcharts.com/) Javascript library and how we can use it to make nice looking charts, from simple ones like bar charts to more complex ones like scatter plots.

##Part 3 - Making a Rails API
This section will explain how to create a simple Rails API with the Rails API gem and ActiveModel Serializers. It will review the basics of creating models, controllers and migrations but in the context of a namespaced API.

##Part 4 - Highcharts with a Rails API
This section highlights connecting a Rails API with Highcharts. It covers data manipulation on both the server and client side to push appropriately formatted data to Highcharts charts for both bar and scatter plots.
